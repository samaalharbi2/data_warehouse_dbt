# Sales Analytics Pipeline (dbt + Snowflake)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **data pipeline and analytics workflow** built using **dbt** and **Snowflake**.  
The pipeline extracts raw data, transforms it into clean, structured tables, and prepares it for analytical insights.

**Key objectives:**
- Build a scalable and maintainable ELT pipeline.
- Transform raw data into staging (`stg_*`) and analytical (`fct_*`, `dim_*`) tables.
- Ensure data quality with dbt tests (unique, not_null, etc.).

# dbt + Snowflake Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a **data modeling and transformation project** built using **dbt** and **Snowflake**.  
The project demonstrates how to structure a data pipeline, create staging and analytical models, and validate data quality.

**Key objectives:**
- Learn and implement dbt models on Snowflake.
- Transform raw tables into staging (`stg_*`) and analytical tables (`my_*_dbt_model`).
- Apply dbt tests to ensure data quality (unique, not_null, accepted_values).
- Gain hands-on experience with Snowflake SQL and dbt workflow.
